Important. All the memory is copied.
> RawRecorder
 It records raw data.
> PlayerRecorder
 It records/plays videos in avi/binary format.
> FileGeneratorManagerAsync
 Core class to generate files.
> VideoGeneratorManager
 Core class to generate videos.
> EnhanceAsyncRecorderManager
 Wrapper of the PlayerRecord. It encodes images and message in a same frame and it creates a video (avi) or binary file (dat, data).
> RecordContainerData
 Asynchronous recorder for files with raw binary data.


TODO
> Object memory should be shared. Clone should be optional.
> Raw recorder should allow the serialization.
> Microbuffer and volatile should be template and not a fix object (pair <string, cv::Mat>)







codify_data.hpp
 CodifyData2Image -> obsolete

sample_codify.cpp (example of codify message inside an image)

RawRecorder : record binary data
sample_rawrecord.cpp
  Record binary data
  Read binary data
sample_rawrecord_serialized.cpp
  Record binary serialized (boost) data.



[x] create_file example
[x] create_video example
combine create_file and create_video
AtomicContainerData uses shared_ptr and move
recordcontainervideo derivate of recordcontainer
  

recordcontainer and create_x(file/video) seems similar


These classes do not guarantee that the data is recorder.
NEG: - No guarantee data is recorded
     - In some scenario no feedback if the data is recorded 
PRO: - Data recorded after a minimum fix interval (data drop if too short time from previous record)
     
create_video create_file (core classes for recording binary/video files)
PlayerRecorder (use create_video/create_file)
RawRecorder (use create_file)
EnhanceAsyncRecorderManager (use PlayerRecorder)
  Derivate class from EnhanceAsyncRecorderManager to manage the recorded data.

These classes guarantee that the data is recorded but the recording time can be slower than the real-time event
NEG: - Loss of event in real world
     - Buffering can grow drastically
     - Data is copied
PRO: - Guarantee all data is recorded

RecordContainerVideo : It creates a single video file (OpenCV xvid format .avi file)
RecordContainerFile (former RecordContainer) : It creates files. IMPORTANT: It saves a file for each pushed data
